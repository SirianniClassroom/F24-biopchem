Module 00: Introducing Python & Symbolic Mathematics
====================================================

This module is designed to introduce the following cyberinfrastructure & mathematical skills:
1. Basic Python syntax, including 
    - Variable assignment
    - `print()` debugging
    - `for` loop iteration and `list` actions
    - `dict` construction
2. Symbolic algebra operations, including
    - Defining and manipulating `Equation` objects using `algebra_with_sympy` 
    - Evaluating algebraic expressions by substituting numerical values and units with `Equation.subs()`
3. Symbolic calculus
    - Evaluating ordinary derivatives of single-variable functions
    - Evaluating partial derivatives of multivariate functions
4. Operator algebra
    - Testing operator linearity
    - Testing operator commutation
    - Evaluating operator exponentiation
    - Evaluating if a function is an eigenfunction of an operator
    - Determining the eigenvalue of an operator's eigenfunction
